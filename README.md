### 📌 Overview (edited)

TradeSentinel is a Python-powered dashboard for real-time portfolio monitoring, providing instant insights into PnL, exposure, and risk metrics throughout the trading day. Designed for trading operations and risk management teams, it helps detect limit breaches early and supports informed decision-making.

The current demo is **stable** and has been validated through extensive testing:
- Core metrics implemented in `metrics.py` were successfully tested in `test_metrics.py` and `test_metrics_edge_cases.py`.  
- Historical data retrieved via **Yahoo Finance (yfinance)** was manually validated to ensure accuracy and consistency with market data.  

Ongoing and planned improvements include:
- Adding dedicated tests for the **Correlation Matrix** functionality.  
- Expanding test coverage for the **Explore & Export PnL Data** section, particularly for filtered datasets.  
- Refactoring `dashboard.py` to improve **modularity** and maintainability.  

> Note: A private experimental variation of TradeSentinel's dashboard is also being developed in a separate repository to explore new features and architectural refinements.


## 🚀 Features
- **Live market data:** Fetches intraday prices from APIs (Yahoo Finance).
   * Supported intraday periods: `1m`, `5m`, `15m`, `30m`, `1h`.
   * If a period of `1d` is selected, the last updated price corresponds to the **last daily close**.
- **PnL tracking:** Calculates mark-to-market PnL by instrument, sector, or portfolio.
   * Note: For historical data, `TradeSentinel` uses adjusted close prices (via auto_adjust=True) to account for dividends and splits. This ensures that PnL calculations reflect total return and avoids artificial price drops on dividend dates.    
- **Risk metrics:** Computes Value-at-Risk (VaR), exposure by asset class, and limit breaches.
- **Interactive dashboard:** Built with Streamlit for intuitive visualization.

## 🛠 Tech stack
- **Python:** `pandas`, `numpy`, `altair`, `streamlit`, `plotly`
- **Data APIs:** `Yahoo Finance`
- **Deployment:** `Streamlit Community Cloud`

## 📂 Project structure
- **data/** — Sample datasets  
- **src/** — Core Python scripts  
  - **ensure_data.py** — Market data ingestion  
  - **dashboard.py** — App UI and visualization

## 📈 Example use case
- **Intraday PnL tracking**: Monitor live portfolio PnL and key metrics during market hours to quickly spot drawdowns or performance spikes.
- **Comprehensive portfolio analysis**: View and explore portfolio metrics and visualizations over a selected time horizon. Analyze historical performance, sector allocation, and asset distribution trends to support medium‑ and long‑term investment decisions.
- **On-demand CSV snapshots**: Export the current portfolio metrics view to CSV for quick sharing, further analysis, or archiving as a daily snapshot.
- **Foundation for scalable financial platforms**: Use `TradeSentinel`’s modular architecture as the starting point for building more complex solutions — for example, integrating with broker APIs for live order execution, adding multi‑asset risk engines, or connecting to internal data warehouses for firm‑wide exposure reporting. Its clean separation between data ingestion, analytics, and visualization makes it easy to extend into a full‑scale portfolio management or risk monitoring system.
